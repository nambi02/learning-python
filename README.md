# Learning Python

This repository contains basic Python scripts as part of my journey to learn Python programming.

## Files

- `latihan1.py`: Basic input/output and arithmetic operations.
- `tebak_angka.py`: A simple number guessing game using conditionals and loops.
- `tugas1.py`: Number guessing game with 3 chances per session.
- `latihan2.py`: Practice of functions (`def`), lists (`[]`), and dictionaries (`{}`), based on daily exercises.
- `kasir.py`: Mini project of a simple cashier app where users can input items and view a shopping cart.
- `tugas2.py`: An upgraded version of the cashier app where the store has predefined categories, and users choose from available items using a dictionary-based system.

## Concepts Covered

- `print()`, `input()`, and basic data types
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Looping (`for`, `while`)
- List operations (`append`, `len`, `index`)
- Dictionary usage (key-value structure)
- Functions (`def`, with and without parameters)
- `enumerate()` for indexed looping
- Simulating simple console-based apps
- Terminal interaction with the user
