# Learning Python

This repository contains basic Python scripts as part of my journey to learn Python programming.

## Files

- `latihan1.py`: Basic input/output and arithmetic operations.
- `tebak_angka.py`: A simple number guessing game using conditionals and loops.
- `tugas1.py`: Number guessing game with 3 chances per session.
- `latihan2.py`: Practice of functions (`def`), lists (`[]`), and dictionaries (`{}`), based on daily exercises.
- `kasir.py`: A mini project where users can input items to a cart and view totals.
- `tugas2.py`: Interactive store simulation with predefined categories using list and dictionary.
- `tugas3.py`: Basic cashier program with:
  - Manual item input from user
  - Data saved to `keranjang.json`
  - Cart viewing, total calculation, and reset feature
- `toko.py`: Advanced store simulation with:
  - Predefined categories and item selection
  - Data saved to `basket.json`
  - Auto-generated shopping receipt in `struk.txt`
  - Reset option for new transactions

## Concepts Covered

- `print()`, `input()`, and basic data types
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Looping (`for`, `while`)
- List operations (`append`, `len`, `index`)
- Dictionary usage (key-value structure)
- Functions (`def`, with and without parameters)
- `enumerate()` for indexed looping
- File Handling with `.json` and `.txt`
- User interaction & simple program architecture

## How to Run

You can run each Python script using Visual Studio Code or any Python IDE.

### Run using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the folder in VS Code:  
   `File > Open Folder > Select your project folder`

2. Make sure you have the **Python extension** installed.

3. Open the script file (e.g., `tugas3.py` or `toko.py`).

4. Press `Ctrl + F5` to run the script, or click the green "Run" button in the top right corner.

> ğŸ’¡ Make sure Python is installed and added to your system PATH.
